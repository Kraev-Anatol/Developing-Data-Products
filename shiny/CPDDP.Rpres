Introduction
========================================================

The search for variables responsible for the behavior of the model is a serious problem. One way to select variables is to use the Akaike information criterion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion
Using the "mtcars" database, we will construct a model of the dependence of mpg (Miles / (US) gallon) on variables that have the greatest influence according to the AIC criterion.

Model building
========================================================

```{r}
AICmodel <- step(lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars), direction = "both", trace = 0) 
summary(AICmodel)
```
The algorithm chose the model with the smallest AIÐ¡. You can view the process by selecting: trace = 1 All independent variables are statistically significant. R-squared acceptably reflects variance.

Model analysis
========================================================

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(AICmodel, col = "blue")
```

Conclusion
========================================================

1. The Akaike information criterion is fairly reliable way to select a model.
2. Residual analysis graphs are very useful tool for assessing the validity of linear regression model.
